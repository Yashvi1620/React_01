        Twenty years ago, we began as a small online retailer that only sold shoes. Today, We still sell shoes- as well as clothing,
        handbags, accessories and more.That "more" is providing the very best cutomer service, customer
        experience, and company culture. We aim to inspire the world by showing it's possible to simultaneously
        deliver happiness to customers, employees, vendors, shareholders, and the community in a long-term, sustainble way.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>We hope that in the future people won't even realize we started selling shoes online. Instead, they'll know
        Zappos as a service company that just happens to sell__________.</p>
